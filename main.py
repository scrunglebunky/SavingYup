# 7/02/2023 - ADDING SPECIFIC STATES

# However, there is no need to have several state classes open at once
# Because of this, it's just gonna s up every state as an object instead of a class

#07/23/2023 - SWITCHING STATES
# States have an issue now where, since they are all initialized at startup, some things that should only be run when the state *actually* starts still appears.
# States now have a method called "on_start" that will remedy this, which will be called in a function here
# All states need to have a value called "next state", too, which will make it able to tell if the state is finished or not
